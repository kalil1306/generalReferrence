Hi Airtel, 

Name: Kalilur Rahman
Mobile Number: 7904044608
Airtel AirFiber Black ID: 10101024019224 - 100 MBPS unlimited

I have a query on my current plan on Airtel AirFiber Black plan, I have been using this AirFiber from last month
while installing this AirFiber in my home and sale's executive mentioned that it is unlimited plan, but now Iam currently facing an issue that my speed as been reduced to below 2mb suddenly I was confused by seeing this speed dropped below than 2mb, then I went to Airtel store(Location: Tiruvallur near Domino's) I raised my concerns and they said that they will take to their manager to look in to the issue.


But after I contacted with the customer care with the help of 121 and conveyed my issue and later they said that I have exceeded more than 1000GB data, now if I have to get the same speed of net then I have topup the data it costs like 300 + GST.

The issue is why it is limited to 1000GB, if the optical fiber line has 3000GB because for the general use 1000GB per month it's not sufficient in customer point of view because in the regular routine if I conmsume for 40 to 50 gb or more than that, then obviously it is not going to be sufficient while installing this AirFiber no one mentioned about this limitation, due to this my office meetings and project work got impacted and escalated, this is totally not fair, previously I used ACT Fibernet they have given me 3300GB per month which is very sufficient for day to day life. I am really not satisfied with this limitation to 1000 GB of the AirFiber. Even my friends were ready to install this Air Fiber but because of this issue that I faced and conveyed if they increase the limitation then you can go for it or else it will really create you an frustration at the middle or end of the month.

So I request you to take care of this issue very seriously.
