STRY1014430 - Remove duplicate ITAM servers by name

Note: Scripted updates for reference (step 3) and attributes (step 4) should skip workflow 
and skip setting system fields by including these 2 functions on the GlideRecord
gr.setWorkflow(false);
gr.autoSysFields(false);

Acceptance criteria:
I know this is complete when scripts are built that will automate:

1. Identification

- Table: cmdb_ci_server & all children
- Discovery Source = ITAM
- Class is Server but NOT IBM Mainframe, IBM Mainframe LPAR, IBM Mainframe Linux, Server Chassis
    (OR Class Is: AIX Server, ESX Server, HPUX Server, Linux Server, Server, Solaris Server, Windows Server)
- More than 1 record by Name

For each set by Name:

2. Primary Record
- Identify primary record as last touched [most recent Updated time stamp]

3. Reference to Task
- All other records, identify if referenced on key table TASK_CI or TASK
- IF reference exists, need to update to sys_id of primary record

4. Mark for deletion
- Mark duplicate record by setting attribute column to: DELETE
- Existing Table Cleaner job will remove duplicate record

Requirement: 

1. Find the duplicate record in the cmdb_ci_server table group by name field and recently updated record using Updated field and
discovery_source as ITAM, sys_class_name is one of AIX Server, ESX Server, HPUX Server, Linux Server, Server, Solaris Server, Windows Server
so here first record is primary record and rest of the records if found then it is duplicate for those records set 'attributes' column as DELETE


2. With the duplicate records found in step 1 get the sys_id of those records and do a query in task_ci table in the ci_item field, 
if the sys_id matches then remove the value from the ci_item field in that record in task_ci table aand set the primary record sys_id of those duplicate 
records which found in step 1.
