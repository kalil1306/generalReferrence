STRY1014430 - Remove duplicate ITAM servers by name

Note: Scripted updates for reference (step 3) and attributes (step 4) should skip workflow 
and skip setting system fields by including these 2 functions on the GlideRecord
gr.setWorkflow(false);
gr.autoSysFields(false);

Acceptance criteria:
I know this is complete when scripts are built that will automate:

1. Identification

- Table: cmdb_ci_server & all children
- Discovery Source = ITAM
- Class is Server but NOT IBM Mainframe, IBM Mainframe LPAR, IBM Mainframe Linux, Server Chassis
    (OR Class Is: AIX Server, ESX Server, HPUX Server, Linux Server, Server, Solaris Server, Windows Server)
- More than 1 record by Name

For each set by Name:

2. Primary Record
- Identify primary record as last touched [most recent Updated time stamp]

3. Reference to Task
- All other records, identify if referenced on key table TASK_CI or TASK
- IF reference exists, need to update to sys_id of primary record

4. Mark for deletion
- Mark duplicate record by setting attribute column to: DELETE
- Existing Table Cleaner job will remove duplicate record
