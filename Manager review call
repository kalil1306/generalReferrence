Accomplishment:

COmpleted Discovery fundamentals on demand course, Iam very curious to learn this personally how this works and also in ESM PI planning this is gonna be one of the 5 principles that we are going to dive init for maturing the CMDB
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

EPIC0021413 - To improve the quality of the CMDB, a list of Load Balancer CIs should be imported from the Casino source system.

previously load balancer and it's relationship was done by the manual csv file type data source to transform the data to Http(s) endpoint table and lb table, now I have did to automate the this process from manual to automation
in the way of flow action using rest message step with the help of POST and GET call to retrive the csv file and attach it on data source
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

EPIC0021048 - To enhance application install completion, the Application Bundle ID needs to be added to the control table u_ws1_apps and available to be written with the API call that WS1 calls to update the list of applications.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
EPIC0021338 - Create ICONIC Information Object and relationships to Business Applications(Iconic - Suite of applications identified in VAST as ICONIC, creates a list of business applications essential to sales and billing for consumer devices. The most critical application suite within Verizon.)

created the relationship, between the VAST ci and its business child CI by fetching only the iconic ci using the SQL sstatement in JDBC data source
-------------------------------------------------------------



Accomplishments Summary:
	•	Completed the Discovery Fundamentals On-Demand course to build foundational knowledge and align with ESM PI planning, where Discovery is one of the five key principles to mature the CMDB.
	•	For EPIC0021413, automated the Load Balancer CI import from the Casino source, replacing the manual CSV upload process with a Flow Action using REST (GET & POST) to fetch and attach the file directly to the Data Source.
	•	For EPIC0021048, enabled Application Bundle ID mapping into the u_ws1_apps control table to support successful app install tracking via WS1 API calls.
	•	For EPIC0021338, created relationships between VAST iconic CIs and their related Business Applications using a JDBC Data Source with SQL to pull only the ICONIC CI records.

August 20, 2025 - Q3 Accomplishments

1. Test/Demo user reporting Lost/Stolen device does not have option of ordering same type of device.
Ex.  Using MTN 4702330768 to report Lost/Stolen.  This device in Handheld Computing is Smartphone (iPhone) but Smartphone is not an option for replacement.  All others appear (Basic Phone, Tablet, Mobile connectivity-type device).  When a ordering a replacement, the user should only see the same type of device.
and In the RITM view, the whole alternate address is not displayed correctly, the Address 2 value is not added to the full Alternate Shipping Address.

this fix is very critical, at the end of sprint it challenged me to understand how the existing functionality made at a very shorter period

2. As of the ServiceNow Zurich release, the call GlideEncrypter will be deprecated and a new method will need to be used to leverage the API connection for retrieving the Casino Load Balancer data

3. Created a new Auto flush for cmdb_software_instance where the record is not updated for 30 days before from the current date and name starts with Jabber
A Table Cleaner [sys_auto_flush] record needs to be created that will remove stale Jabber records from Software Instance.
Table: cmdb_software_instance
Filter: Name starts with "Jabber"
Match Field: sys_updated_on
Age in Seconds: 2592000  (30 Days)

4. For the Computer Accessories catalog item, once a PR # is established with Ariba, the customer should no longer be able to cancel the order via the AYS interface. We need to disable the ability for users to cancel this specific type of request once the PR # is opened for Ariba. here the challenge to stop cancelling the request that needs to be touch the exisiting widgets in the service portal that should not impact globally since its a global widget and getting more technical skills in service portal scripting


I want this above statements to be more elaborated because these are my accomplishments that I have to keep an email to my manager

Subject: Accomplishments Update – ServiceNow Enhancements

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I would like to share some of the key accomplishments I have completed in ServiceNow during this sprint:
	1.	Lost/Stolen Device Ordering Flow Enhancement
	•	Resolved a critical issue where Test/Demo users reporting a Lost/Stolen device were not provided with the option to order the same type of replacement device.
	•	For example, when a user reported a Lost/Stolen Smartphone (iPhone), the replacement option did not include Smartphone, but displayed unrelated device types such as Basic Phone, Tablet, Mobile Connectivity Device.
	•	Enhanced the ordering logic so that users will now only see the same type of device available for replacement, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the Lost/Stolen device replacement workflow.
	•	Additionally, corrected an issue in the RITM view where the Alternate Shipping Address was not being displayed fully. The Address Line 2 value was not appended earlier, but now the complete address is displayed, improving clarity for request tracking.
	•	This was a critical fix delivered towards the end of the sprint, which required me to quickly understand the existing implementation and make targeted changes without breaking other dependencies.
	2.	API Encryption Update for Casino Load Balancer Data (Zurich Release)
	•	As part of the ServiceNow Zurich release readiness, identified and remediated the upcoming deprecation of the GlideEncrypter API call.
	•	Implemented the new encryption method for API connections used to retrieve Casino Load Balancer data, ensuring the integration continues to function seamlessly post-upgrade.
	•	This proactive change prevents potential disruptions in data flow once Zurich release goes live.
	3.	CMDB Auto Flush for Jabber Software Instances
	•	Created a new Auto Flush [sys_auto_flush] job for the cmdb_software_instance table to automatically remove stale Jabber records.
	•	Configured the job to identify records where:
	•	The Name starts with “Jabber”
	•	The record has not been updated in the past 30 days (2,592,000 seconds)
	•	This automated cleanup improves CMDB data quality, reduces noise from outdated software instances, and ensures that reporting and reconciliation processes rely on accurate data.
	4.	Computer Accessories Order Cancellation Restriction (Ariba PR Integration)
	•	Implemented a solution to restrict users from cancelling Computer Accessories requests once a Purchase Requisition (PR #) has been created in Ariba.
	•	This required enhancing logic in the AYS (At Your Service) Service Portal widget while ensuring the change did not impact other global widgets or existing request workflows.
	•	The solution involved precise customization to maintain global widget stability while addressing the specific cancellation control requirement.
	•	This change ensures proper alignment with procurement processes and prevents business disruptions caused by cancellations after the PR has been established.

⸻

These accomplishments required working across Catalog Items, RITM views, Service Portal widgets, CMDB auto-flush jobs, and API integrations, strengthening my technical expertise in ServiceNow scripting, data management, and platform upgrade readiness.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
