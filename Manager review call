Employee comment:

The stories which is assigned to me, delieverd on time without any scope creep on scrum ceremonies, there is no failure while deploying stories assigned to me in PROD, no reqoerk for my assigned to stories.

to improve the platform performance, removed many unwanted logs statement's from many scripts in the asset team after a deepdive analysis and used a new feature called 'Access Analyser' to get what role or access control needs to the user for CRUD operations this feature helped me to complete one of the complex stories on CSDM

upskilling myself to get adopt with ECMA script for the development work and very curious that how it can used in our regular work
